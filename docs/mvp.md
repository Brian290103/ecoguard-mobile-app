### 2. Organization-Based Resolution

-   **Functionality:**
    -   Receive reports assigned to them by officers.
    -   View and manage a dashboard of their assigned reports.
    -   Mark reports as "Resolved" after taking action.

### 3. Officer Oversight and Triage
-   **Role:** Environmental Officers/Authorities
-   **Functionality:**
    -   Review incoming reports from users.

## Core Workflow

1.  A **User** spots an environmental issue and submits a report through the EcoGuard app.
2.  An **Officer** reviews the new report, verifies its legitimacy, and assigns it to a relevant **Organization**.
3.  The assigned **Organization** receives the report, investigates the issue, and takes action to resolve it.
4.  Once resolved, the **Organization** updates the report's status to "Resolved".
5.  The **User** who created the report is notified of the status change.

This workflow creates a closed-loop system that ensures environmental issues are reported, managed, and resolved in a transparent and efficient manner.
